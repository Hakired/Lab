**Malware Analysis** and **Malware Labs** are typically associated with the **Red Team**, but they are considered **independent, neutral categories**. They focus on understanding and analyzing malware, which can be used proactively for penetration testing or understanding attack vectors. However, they are not limited to the Red Team and can be applied by any team for various purposes.  
Similarly, **Forensics** is commonly associated with the **Blue Team**, but it is also an **independent, neutral category**. Forensics is used to investigate and analyze the aftermath of an attack, preserving and analyzing digital evidence. While often used by the Blue Team for incident response, it can be utilized by any team depending on the context.  
In summary, both **Malware Analysis** and **Forensics** are not tied to any single team and can be leveraged by both Red and Blue Teams (or other specialized teams) for various goals.

Although Reverse Engineering is mainly used by the Red Team and in Malware Labs, it is such a broad and technical discipline that it can also be valuable for the Blue Team and Forensics to analyze malicious behavior or examine vulnerabilities.

::: tip 🎯 **Understanding Purple Teams**
- **What is a Purple Team?**  
  A Purple Team bridges the gap between offensive (Red) and defensive (Blue) operations, fostering collaboration to improve threat detection and response. Their role includes coordinating testing, validating controls, and accelerating the feedback loop between attack simulation and defense improvement.
- **Purple Team vs Red/Blue/Pentesting vs Threat Hunting**  
  Unlike Red or Blue teams that operate independently, or traditional penetration testers who focus solely on finding vulnerabilities, Purple Teams align both attack and defense efforts. They also differ from threat hunters, who proactively search for threats; Purple Teams simulate realistic threats to validate detection and defenses.
- **Red, Blue, Purple, Pentester & Threat Hunter – What's the difference?**

🔹 **Red Team** – Simulates real-world attacks to test detection & response.  
🔹 **Blue Team** – Detects, responds to, and mitigates attacks.  
🔹 **Purple Team** – Bridges Red & Blue to validate and improve detection.  
🔹 **Pentester** – Focuses on vulnerabilities and reporting risk.  
🔹 **Threat Hunter** – Actively searches for hidden threats inside networks.

Use **Role Comparison Matrices** and define **Scope & Objectives** to understand how each contributes to a mature security strategy.
